# Document Clustering 

###### Made by Timothy Avni (tavni96) & Peter Simkin (DolphinDance)

We present a way to cluster text documents by stacking features from TFIDF, pretrained word embeddings and text hashing.

We then reduce these dimensions using UMAP and HDBSCAN to produce a 2-D D3.js visualisation.
